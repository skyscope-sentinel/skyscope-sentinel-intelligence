# Skyscope Sentinel Intelligence

## Project Overview
Skyscope Sentinel Intelligence is an enterprise-grade AI development platform designed to leverage multi-agent swarms powered by Huggingface models. This platform enables developers to orchestrate Docker containers, deploy AI agents, and generate media content at unrivaled speed and efficiency. With its sleek design featuring a black and purple nebula theme with lime green accents, Skyscope introduces an innovative approach to development, tailored for both individual developers and organizations.

## Installation
To set up the Skyscope Sentinel Intelligence platform locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/skyscope-sentinel-intelligence.git
   cd skyscope-sentinel-intelligence
   ```

2. **Set up a local server:**
   You can use any web server of your choice to serve the static files. For example, using `Live Server` in VS Code or `http-server`.
   ```bash
   npx http-server . -o
   ```

3. **Configuration:**
   Modify the `config.js` file to adjust the API URLs and configurations according to your local environment or production settings.

## Usage
Once you have installed the platform, open your web browser and navigate to the local server address (default is usually `http://localhost:8080` or similar). You can start deploying AI agent swarms, orchestrating Docker containers, and exploring the features provided by Skyscope Sentinel Intelligence.

### Example Command
In the terminal mockup on the homepage, you can simulate deployment commands:
```bash
$ skyscope deploy --agents=5 --task="build-webapp"
```
